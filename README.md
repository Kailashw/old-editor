# Project Name : old-editor
<h2> Realtime Collobarative Editor with Multiple Users.</h2>

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p> I have modified this code from the privously forked code of older react version. The aim is to reproduce the same code in react latest version someday(not too far ofcourse). I used a host of different technologies including <a href="https://socket.io/">Socket.io</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/api.html">Express</a> and <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a> to name a few.</p>


<h3> How to get the app running</h3>
<ol>

<li> Pull the code to your local machine either by dowloading the zip folder of the git <a href="https://github.com/Kailashw/old-editor"> repo </a> or by cloning it using gitbash.  You can use <code>git clone https://github.com/Kailashw/old-editor </code> to copy the repo onto your machine.</li>

<li>In your terminal, navigate inside the code folder and run <code>npm install</code> </li>
<li>Finally run <code>npm start</code> and the app should open on localhost port 3000</li>

<li>Hack Away!!</li>
</ol>
